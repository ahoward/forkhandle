<h2>NAME</h2>

<p>forkhandle</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>connection = ForkHandle.get(:db_connection){ Db.connect(config) }</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>managing connection across forks and threads is tricky.  most libraries use
  and icky idiom that requires each and every client to configure it&#39;s own
  forking logic, something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">MyLameLib</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">after_fork</span> <span class="k">do</span>

  <span class="c1"># close handles you should close</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>many libs also do not provide you with per-thread connection, making MT a
  manual process.</p>

<p>a teeny bit of code can solve both.  the concept is simple:</p>

<p>maintain a table of connections scoped by process id and thread id.  any
  miss will trigger auto-scrubbing the table, but only connections from
  another process (we&#39;ve been forked) will be closed.  this gives</p>

<ul>
<li><p>per thread connections</p></li>
<li><p>per process connections</p></li>
<li><p>auto-matic cleanup after a fork</p></li>
</ul>
